## About this project

This project contains sources for the Microsoft(r) Flight Simulator 2020.

All the airports you find here are not intented _by me_ to be very detailled.
They are meant to be support for flight simulator enthusiasts which are
using economic addons like

- [Fly The World](http://www.ftw-sim.de/)
- [FSEconomy](https://www.fseconomy.net/)

Hence, the airports provided by me won't contain more than the runways, some
taxiways, maybe parking areas and a tower with VFR frequencies.

## If you want more ...

... you can download my models here and modify them as you need. When done,
just create a pull request and i will merge your changes and add the to the
next release of the airport.

## ... But

... please have an eye if you add 3D models. If you don't have at least 3
LODs (level of details) i will regret the pull request.

Why? Becaus some people (like me) don't have extremely performant hardware.
When adding 3D models with too many vertices, the performance of the 
flight simulator will drop. To prevent from this, LODs with less vertices are
needed.

If you still want spoil the performance of your flight simulator for 
yourself, you can fork the project, add 3D models like you want and build
your own package. 

In case you are publishing the result it would be kind if you would
make a remark to my work. 

Thanks and have fun when flying!

## Publishing

When released, i will publish the airport using their ICAO code, on 
[flightsim.to](http://flightsim.to).

In case someone has added details, i will mention this when publishing.

## Licensing

... I don't like to browse through the available licenses.
Just use the sources like you want. If you become a millionaire using
my souces: congratulations. It would be kind, if you gave me some
bucks of your earned millions ;-)

## Removing

As soon as Microsoft or Asobo contacts me that one of these airports
is now a permanent element of the flight simulator, i will remove it from
this repository.
